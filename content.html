          14-year-old teenage bookworm Shizuku lives a simple life, dominated by
          her love for stories and writing. One day she notices that all the
          library books she has have been previously checked out by the same
          person: 'Seiji Amasawa'. Curious as to who he is, Shizuku meets a boy
          of her age whom she finds infuriating, but discovers to her shock that
          he is her 'Prince of Books'. As she grows closer to him, she realises
          that he merely read all those books to bring himself closer to her.
          The boy, Seiji, aspires to be a violin maker in Italy, and it is his
          dreams that make Shizuku realise that she has no clear path for her
          life. Knowing that her strength lies in writing, she tests her talents
          by writing a story about Baron, a cat statuette belonging to Seiji's
          grandfather.

        <p class="article__content">
          Arrietty, a tiny, but tenacious 14-year-old, lives with her parents in
          the recesses of a suburban garden home, unbeknownst to the homeowner.
          Like all little people, Arrietty remains hidden from view, except
          during occasional covert ventures beyond the floorboards to "borrow"
          scrap supplies from her human hosts. But when 12-year-old Shawn, a
          human boy who comes to stay in the home, discovers his mysterious
          housemate one evening, a secret friendship blossoms. If discovered,
          their relationship could drive Arrietty's family from the home and
          straight into danger.

        <h2 class="article__title">From Up On Poppy Hill - 2011</h2>
        <p class="article__content">
          The story is set in Yokohama, Japan in 1963. In preparation for the
          next year's Tokyo Summer Olympics, people are destroying the old
          things because they believe only in the magnificence of the new. A
          16-year-old girl, Umi, lives in the boarding house called "Coquelicot
          Manor", which is located on the hill overlooking the harbour of the
          Port of Yohohama in Japan. Each morning, she raises a set of signal
          flags with message "I pray for safe voyages". A 17-year-old boy, Shun,
          always sees this flag from the sea as he rides a tugboat to school.
          Gradually Umi and Shun are drawn to each other, but a sudden obstacle
          appears: Shun finds out that they might be a familiar secret between
          the two.
